# streetlist

This script generates compact descriptions of the mapping from street addresses to voting precincts.
The input required is a street list extract from the MA voter registration information system.
The output is a csv table that can be imported into a spreadsheet editor to be formatted for printing with the published street listing book.
This has been used once, on one city's list of residents. Please inspect output carefully before trusting it.
